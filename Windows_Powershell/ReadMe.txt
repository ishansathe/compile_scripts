Download/Clone/Copy this file onto your PC at the location where your c program is 

Please make sure that you have the target file and the compiling script at the same location
The compiler script will create the executable file at the location where you have called the script

It is still in premature stage so doing things otherwise can give you funny results


Example: If you called the file at Desktop
and the target c program file is in 'xyz' folder
and you submitted the prompt as 
xyz/target.c

The executable file will be created as xyz/target.exe
